# Audits example (broken links)
This is a refactored version of the [Audit panel example](http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/samples.html#devtools.audits) found in the devtools documentation. Actual refactoring is actually
only movement of files into a directory structure which enabled me to better understand the example.

## Usage
Open the WebInspector and the Audits pane. Check the 'Broken Links' check box and uncheck the others. Press the 'Run' button.
